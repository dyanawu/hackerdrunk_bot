# hackerdrunk_bot

The `hackerdrunk_bot` is our project to setup a bot for hackerdrinks' Telegram chat

See the [issue list](https://github.com/hackerdrinks-sg/hackerdrunk_bot/issues) for tasks to pick up and/or discuss

## Current Goals

1. Become the only place where a member of the community can invite another (Invite disabled except for the bot)
2. This bot will eventually have authentication/verification functionality to allow our shared services to interact and verify a user who is signing up


## Usage

This bot when added to a room, will look out for members of the group who add another user directly or by sharing a invite link to another user which was generated by DMing the bot with a `/invite` command.

## Development

To run this locally for development:

1. Make sure you have an existing Telegram bot account already created
2. Copy `.env.sample` into `.env` and replace values with actual values
3. export $(cat .env | xargs) # to save and use the env
4. Make sure your bot has joined the room that you specified in the `ROOM_ID`
5. go run main.go

## Sample output

The bot writes into a local file everytime someone joins the Telegram Group (room) either by a direct invite (Add User) or by generating a link with the `/invite` command to the bot.

A sample of how an entry looks like is below:

```
{"inviter":"usernameA","invitee":"username","invite_type":"direct_invite","timestamp":"2022-04-17T05:32:33.102199829Z"}
```
